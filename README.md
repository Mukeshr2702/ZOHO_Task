# ZOHO_Task
Task1.cpp :
In a folder, have some files in .txt format. Read the contents of the file and remove the words if they are printed more than once. 
Example: "Read a file file file" has to be converted to "Read a file".
Create 10 threads and do the above processing in a parallel manner.
If the number of files is less than 10, then create number of threads equal to the number of files. 
Example: If there is only one file in the folder then create only one thread.
Print the total time taken for execution.

Task2.py :

Task3.ipynb :
Choose any machine learning model with unstructured data, train the model and predict for test input.

Task4.ipynb :
Train a model with unstructured data with a minimum of 100 epochs and prove that increasing epoch decreases the loss.

Task5.ipynb :
Train the same model with one hidden layer.Document the performance improvement on using this layer.

Task6(cpu).ipynb & Task6(gpu).ipynb :
Compare the training times on a CPU vs GPU
